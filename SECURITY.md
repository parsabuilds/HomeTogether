# Security Overview

## 🔒 Security Assessment for Public Release

This document outlines the security measures and considerations for the HomeTogether project.

## ✅ Security Status: SAFE FOR PUBLIC RELEASE

### What's Safe to Expose

#### Firebase Configuration Values
The Firebase configuration values in the code are **public client identifiers**, not secret keys:
- `apiKey` - Public client API key
- `authDomain` - Public domain identifier  
- `projectId` - Public project identifier
- `storageBucket` - Public storage bucket name
- `messagingSenderId` - Public messaging identifier
- `appId` - Public app identifier

These values are designed to be exposed in client-side applications.

#### Source Code
- No hardcoded passwords or secret keys
- All sensitive operations use proper authentication
- API keys stored in Google Cloud Secret Manager
- Environment variables properly configured

### 🔐 Actual Security Measures

#### Authentication & Authorization
- **Firebase Authentication**: Industry-standard auth system
- **Firestore Security Rules**: Comprehensive data access control
- **Role-based Access**: Agent vs Client permissions
- **Invitation-only Registration**: Secure client onboarding

#### Data Protection
- **User Isolation**: Users can only access their own data
- **Membership-based Dashboards**: Access controlled by membership arrays
- **Real-time Security**: Rules apply to all database operations
- **Secure Cloud Functions**: Proper authentication for API endpoints

### 🚨 Required Setup for New Installations

#### Firebase Project Setup
1. Create your own Firebase project
2. Enable Firestore and Authentication
3. Deploy the security rules from `PRODUCTION_FIRESTORE_RULES.md`
4. Replace placeholder config values with your project's values

#### Email Service Setup (Optional)
1. Create Brevo account and get API key
2. Store API key in Google Cloud Secret Manager
3. Update email addresses in Cloud Functions
4. Deploy Cloud Functions

### 🔍 Security Audit Results

#### No Security Issues Found:
- ✅ No hardcoded secrets or passwords
- ✅ No exposed database credentials  
- ✅ No API keys in source code
- ✅ Proper environment variable usage
- ✅ Secure authentication implementation
- ✅ Comprehensive access controls

#### Areas Requiring User Configuration:
- 🔧 Firebase project values (must be replaced)
- 🔧 Email addresses in contact form (clearly marked as TODOs)
- 🔧 Cloud Function URLs (project-specific)

## 📋 Pre-Deployment Checklist

Before deploying your own instance:

- [ ] Replace all Firebase config values with your project's values
- [ ] Update email addresses in Cloud Functions
- [ ] Deploy Firestore security rules
- [ ] Set up Brevo API key in Secret Manager (if using contact form)
- [ ] Test authentication flow
- [ ] Verify invitation system works
- [ ] Test dashboard creation and access

## 🛡️ Ongoing Security Recommendations

1. **Monitor Firebase Usage**: Set up billing alerts and usage monitoring
2. **Regular Updates**: Keep dependencies updated
3. **Access Reviews**: Regularly review user access and permissions
4. **Backup Strategy**: Implement regular Firestore backups
5. **Error Monitoring**: Set up error tracking and monitoring

**Summary**: This codebase is secure and ready for public release. All sensitive values are properly externalized and all security best practices are implemented.
